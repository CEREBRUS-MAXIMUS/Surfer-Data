## Prerequisites

1. **Desktop Application**: The Surfer desktop application must be running in the background for the SDK to work.
   - Follow the installation instructions on the [Desktop Application Installation](/desktop/installation) page
   - Connect your platforms and export your data to use with the SDK.

> Note: The desktop app runs a local server on port 2024 that the SDK communicates with. Make sure the server is running before using the SDK.
