## How it works

![Surfer Diagram](assets/SurferDiagram.png)

1. Click on "Export" to initiate the data extraction process.
2. The app waits for the target page to load completely.
3. The system checks if the user is signed in to the platform being scraped.
4. If not signed in, the user is prompted to sign in.
5. If signed in, the process continues.
6. Once signed in, the app interacts with the platform's user interface.
7. The app then scrapes the user's data from the platform.
8. Finally, the extracted data is exported and saved to your local storage.

## Sample Exported Data

```json{
  "platform_name": "X Corp",
  "name": "Twitter",
  "runID": "twitter-001-1724267514217",
  "timestamp": 1724267623318,
  "content": [
    "Twitter Post 1",
    "Twitter Post 2",
    "Twitter Post 3",
    ...
  ]
}
```
