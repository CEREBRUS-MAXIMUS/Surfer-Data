mmh3 is a Python extension for [MurmurHash (MurmurHash3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MurmurHash), a set of fast and robust non-cryptographic hash functions invented by Austin Appleby.

Combined with probabilistic techniques like a [Bloom filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter), [MinHash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MinHash), and [feature hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_hashing), mmh3 allows you to develop high-performance systems in fields such as data mining, machine learning, and natural language processing.

Another common use of mmh3 is to [calculate favicon hashes](https://gist.github.com/yehgdotnet/b9dfc618108d2f05845c4d8e28c5fc6a) used by [Shodan](https://www.shodan.io), the world's first IoT search engine.

## How to use
### Install
```shell
pip install mmh3 # for macOS, use "pip3 install mmh3" and python3
```

### Simple functions
Quickstart:
```shell
>>> import mmh3
>>> mmh3.hash("foo") # returns a 32-bit signed int
-156908512
>>> mmh3.hash("foo", 42) # uses 42 as a seed
-1322301282
>>> mmh3.hash("foo", signed=False) # returns a 32-bit unsigned int
4138058784
```

Other functions:
```shell
>>> mmh3.hash64("foo") # two 64 bit signed ints (by using the 128-bit algorithm as its backend)
(-2129773440516405919, 9128664383759220103)
>>> mmh3.hash64("foo", signed=False) #  two 64 bit unsigned ints
(16316970633193145697, 9128664383759220103)
>>> mmh3.hash128("foo", 42) # 128 bit unsigned int
215966891540331383248189432718888555506
>>> mmh3.hash128("foo", 42, signed=True) # 128 bit signed int
-124315475380607080215185174712879655950
>>> mmh3.hash_bytes("foo") # 128 bit value as bytes
'aE\xf5\x01W\x86q\xe2\x87}\xba+\xe4\x87\xaf~'
>>> import numpy as np
>>> a = np.zeros(2 ** 32, dtype=np.int8)
>>> mmh3.hash_bytes(a)
b'V\x8f}\xad\x8eNM\xa84\x07FU\x9c\xc4\xcc\x8e'
```

Beware that `hash64` returns **two** values, because it uses the 128-bit version of MurmurHash3 as its backend.

`hash_from_buffer` hashes byte-likes without memory copying. The method is suitable when you hash a large memory-view such as `numpy.ndarray`.

```shell
>>> mmh3.hash_from_buffer(numpy.random.rand(100))
-2137204694
>>> mmh3.hash_from_buffer(numpy.random.rand(100), signed=False)
3812874078
```

`hash64`, `hash128`, and `hash_bytes` have the third argument for architecture optimization (keyword arg: `x64arch`). Use True for x64 and False for x86 (default: True):

```shell
>>> mmh3.hash64("foo", 42, True) 
(-840311307571801102, -6739155424061121879)
```

### `hashlib`-style hashers
`mmh3` implements hashers whose interfaces are similar to `hashlib` in the standard library: `mmh3_32()` for 32 bit hashing, `mmh3_x64_128()` for 128 bit hashing optimized for x64 architectures, and `mmh3_x86_128()` for 128 bit hashing optimized for x86 architectures.

In addition to the standard `digest()` method, each hasher has `sintdigest()`, which returns a signed integer, and `uintdigest()`, which returns an unsigned integer. 128 bit hashers also have `stupledigest()` and `utupledigest()` which return two 64 bit integers.

Note that as of version 4.1.0, the implementation is still experimental and its performance can be unsatisfactory (especially `mmh3_x86_128()`). Also, `hexdigest()` is not supported. Use `digest().hex()` instead.

```shell
>>> import mmh3
>>> hasher = mmh3.mmh3_x64_128(seed=42)
>>> hasher.update(b"foo")
>>> hasher.update(b"bar")
>>> hasher.update("foo") # str inputs are not allowed for hashers
TypeError: Strings must be encoded before hashing
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
>>> hasher.digest()
b'\x82_n\xdd \xac\xb6j\xef\x99\xb1e\xc4\n\xc9\xfd'
>>> hasher.sintdigest() # 128 bit signed int
-2943813934500665152301506963178627198
>>> hasher.uintdigest() # 128 bit unsigned int
337338552986437798311073100468589584258
>>> hasher.stupledigest() # two 64 bit signed ints
(7689522670935629698, -159584473158936081)
>>> hasher.utupledigest() # two 64 bit unsigned ints
(7689522670935629698, 18287159600550615535)
```

## Known Issues
### Getting different results from other MurmurHash3-based libraries
By default, mmh3 returns **signed** values for 32-bit and 64-bit versions and **unsigned** values for `hash128`, due to historical reasons. Please use the keyword argument `signed` to obtain a desired result.

From version 4.0.0, `mmh3` returns the same value under big-endian platforms
    as that under little-endian ones, while the original C++ library is endian-sensitive. If you need to obtain the original-compliant results under big-endian environments, please use version 3.*.

For compatibility with [Google Guava (Java)](https://github.com/google/guava), see <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29932956/murmur3-hash-different-result-between-python-and-java-implementation>.

For compatibility with [murmur3 (Go)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/spaolacci/murmur3), see <https://github.com/hajimes/mmh3/issues/46>.

### Unexpected results when given non 32-bit seeds
Version 2.4 changed the type of seeds from signed 32-bit int to unsigned 32-bit int. The resulting values with signed seeds still remain the same as before, as long as they are 32-bit.

```shell
>>> mmh3.hash("aaaa", -1756908916) # signed representation for 0x9747b28c
1519878282
>>> mmh3.hash("aaaa", 2538058380) # unsigned representation for 0x9747b28c
1519878282
```

Be careful so that these seeds do not exceed 32-bit. Unexpected results may happen with invalid values.

```shell
>>> mmh3.hash("foo", 2 ** 33)
-156908512
>>> mmh3.hash("foo", 2 ** 34)
-156908512
```
